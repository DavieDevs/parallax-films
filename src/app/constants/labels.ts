        "Parallax Films was a joy to work with for our wedding video. They were easy to contact, easygoing, and respectful throughout the entire process. Damian has a keen eye for detail and paid close attention to the lighting, resulting in a unique and beautifully compiled video. He captured all the special moments, including drone footage, behind-the-scenes details, and a social media clip that helped tell the story of our wedding day. We highly recommend Parallax Films to any couple looking for a talented videographer for their big day.",

        "Damian was incredible to work with from the minute I sent him a message inquiring about pricing. He was honest, straightforward, and quick to respond. We had a phone call to talk about what my husband and I were looking for, and Damian was quick to come up with options when I shared that my husband isn't the most natural in front of a camera. Damian was on time for the wedding, stayed a little later to capture our last moments, and delivered a wedding video that we continue to get compliments on. He captured every shot we asked for and had great ideas/posing that made this awkward couple look good. He was professional, worked well with the photographer, calm throughout the day, and exceeded expectations. I would highly recommend booking Damian/Parallax Films for your wedding! A wonderful experience through and through",

        "Damian, we cannot thank you enough for the incredible wedding video you created for us. Every time we watch it, we are moved to tears. You captured our day so beautifully, not just through posed shots, but in the genuine, spontaneous moments that truly reflect who we are as a couple—playful, laughing, smiling, and enjoying each other. The drone footage was absolutely stunning, offering a unique and breathtaking perspective of our wedding. The separate speech videos were a wonderful touch, allowing us to relive those heartfelt words again and again. Your work has given us a treasured keepsake that we will cherish for years and years. You didn't just film our wedding; you captured the essence of our love and the joy of our celebration. We are forever grateful for your incredible talent and dedication. This video is everything we imagined and more!",

        "We gave our vision of a documentary style Highlight Video Drone Service and received so much more than that!! We got our video on time and brought us to tears when we watched it! Couldn’t believe he was able to capture our venue to make it look so dreamy and amazing. Guided us on how to pose, something that’s important to me. Definitely something we’ll look back when we’re old to relive the moment! So many beautiful candid shots of not only us but our dearest family!! Very professional and easy to work with. Thank you so much!! ",
